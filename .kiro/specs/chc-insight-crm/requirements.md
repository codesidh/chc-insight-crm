# Requirements Document

## Introduction

CHC Insight is a comprehensive CRM application designed for Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS) business within Managed Care Organization (MCO) environments. The system captures case and assessment data through a hierarchical form management system to meet state requirements while tracking member, provider, and internal performance metrics. The application features a dynamic form engine with taxonomical organization (Categories → Types → Templates → Instances), workflow management, role-based access control, and comprehensive reporting capabilities to support healthcare compliance and quality management.

## Form Taxonomy Structure

The system organizes forms using a four-level hierarchy:

```
Form Category (Level 1)
└─ Form Type (Level 2)
    └─ Form Template (Level 3)
        └─ Form Instance (Level 4)
```

### Form Categories
- **Cases**: Operational workflows (BH Referrals, Appeals, Grievances)
- **Assessments**: Evaluation and monitoring forms (Health Risk, Member Satisfaction, Provider Performance)

### Example Structure
```
Cases (Category)
├─ BH Referrals (Type)
│   ├─ BH Initial Referral v1.0 (Template)
│   ├─ BH Initial Referral v2.0 (Template)
│   └─ BH Follow-up Referral v1.0 (Template)
├─ Appeals (Type)
│   ├─ Medical Service Appeal v1.0 (Template)
│   └─ Pharmacy Appeal v1.0 (Template)
└─ Grievances (Type)
